# Smail: The Smart Email Daemon

## The problem

Email is old, crusty, slow, and hard to use. It's been so tacked on over time, that it doesn't function well in many situations anymore.

## Solving the problem

Use Email as a protocol, and not the communication method.

- All communication with the server should be encrypted, including the message itself.
- Mail should be able to be sent over any protocol
- Mail should be able to be distributed over many providers
- You can have a broker setup on your localhost, on a remote server, and use whatever you want as a frontend.

## What this aims to be

A new form of email, that will support many protocols, especially IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.

Modern standards to an old problem.
